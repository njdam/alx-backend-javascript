# ALX BACKEND JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript can be used for backend development through the use of server-side JavaScript frameworks and runtime environments.

Here are some popular options for building backend applications with JavaScript:

1. Node.js:

* Description: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome and enables building scalable and high-performance network applications.

* Key Features:
	* Non-blocking I/O operations.
	* Event-driven architecture.
	* NPM (Node Package Manager) for managing libraries and modules.

* Example Frameworks:
	* Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
	* Koa.js: A modern, lightweight, and expressive framework for building web applications.


2. Deno:

* Description: Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built on the V8 JavaScript engine and Rust. It was created by the same individual who created Node.js and is designed to address some of Node.js' shortcomings.
* Key Features:
	* Secure by default (requires explicit permissions).
	* Built-in TypeScript support.
	* Standard library included.

* Example Frameworks:
	* Oak: A middleware framework for Deno inspired by Koa.


3. Express.js (with MongoDB):

* Description: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is commonly used with Express for data storage.

* Key Features:
	* Middleware support.
	* Routing system.
	* Template engines for rendering views.

* Example Framework:
	* Express.js (paired with Mongoose for MongoDB interactions).


4. NestJS (with TypeScript):

* Description: NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and heavily inspired by Angular.

* Key Features:
	* Modular architecture.
	* Dependency injection.
	* Support for WebSockets.

* Example Framework:
	* NestJS with TypeScript.


5. Meteor:

* Description: Meteor is a full-stack JavaScript framework for building modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of developing end-to-end applications with a single language for both client and server.
* Key Features:
	* Real-time updates with built-in WebSocket support.
	* Database agnostic (supports MongoDB by default).
	* Integrated build system.

* Example Framework:
	* Meteor.js.
