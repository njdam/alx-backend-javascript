## Setup

To run the tests, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Tests

To execute the unit tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
This command will run all the tests in the project and display the results in the terminal.

## Test Framework
We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test framework for writing and executing tests. Mocha provides a simple and flexible way to structure and run tests.

## Writing Tests
Tests are written using the [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion library. Chai provides various assertion styles to suit different preferences.

Tests are located in the `tests` directory and are organized according to the module or component they are testing.

To add a new test, create a new file in the appropriate directory within the tests folder. Follow the naming convention `<module-name>.test.js`.

Example test file:

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { myFunction } = require('../src/myModule');

describe('myFunction', () => {
    it('should return true if ...', () => {
        // Test code here
        expect(myFunction(/* input */)).to.be.true;
    });

    it('should return false if ...', () => {
        // Test code here
        expect(myFunction(/* input */)).to.be.false;
    });
});
```

## Conventions
* Test files are named with the .test.js extension.
* Use descriptive test and assertion messages for better clarity.
* Organize tests logically based on the module/component being tested.
